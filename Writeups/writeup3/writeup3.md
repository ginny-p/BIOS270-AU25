In this class, I learned about SQL and querying. It is a very powerful tool to handle data and later analyze it. I learned some important commands for it as well. From the readings, I also learned abot the python packages that aid in data analysis: Numpy and pandas. These are used in most pipelines due to their simplicity in handling data analysis.
